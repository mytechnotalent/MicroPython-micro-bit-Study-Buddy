# MicroPython-micro-bit
# Study Buddy
The micro:bit Study Buddy is a micro:bit Electronic Educational Engagement Tool designed to help students learn a new classroom subject with the assistance of a micro:bit TED (Talking Educational Database) and a micro:bit TEQ (Talking Educational Quiz).

## Mission Statement
Over the next 10 years we are going to see a fundamental transformation of technology in a way never before seen in history.  

Future careers will look very different than they do today to which literally every opportunity will include the usage of a microcontroller in combination with an automation engine and the skills necessary to adapt to this new paradigm.

With this landscape directly over the horizon we need to empower our Educators, the single more important group of leaders in the twenty-first century, with the tools necessary to inspire and engage the next generation of makers in an exciting new way.

Today is born the concept of a micro:bit Electronic Educational Engagement Tool to connect with students in a very emotional and inspiring way which will help solidify classroom subject curriculum in a significantly enhanced time frame in addition to preparing these future leaders with the software engineering fundamentals necessary to compete in tomorrow's economy.

The micro:bit Electronic Educational Engagement Tool is comprised of a micro:bit TED (Talking Educational Database) and a micro:bit TEQ (Talking Educational Quiz) to enhance Educators world-wide with the curriculum integration to take their students to the next level.

## Project Hypothetical
YOU are a History and Biology Educator and are about to teach your students the 50 state capitals of the US in your history curriculum in addition to parts of a cell in your biology curriculum.  YOU now have a grant and with that grant a micro:bit V2 for each student and YOU get to take advantage of the micro:bit EEET (Electronic Educational Engagement Tool) to integrate into your curriculum!

YOU follow the steps below and very easily see how YOU can integrate this technology in a way NEVER done in history!  YOU will be able to BRING TO LIFE a micro:bit TED (Talking Educational Database) or talking chat bot that can help the student learn the 50 state capitals and the parts of a cell as it makes facial animations and literally TALKS to the student!

The student will then be able to work with the micro:bit TED on their own to help strengthen their curriculum concept development and then take the micro:bit TEQ to help them prepare for the subject exam or test.  They can engage the TED and TEQ on demand which will build their confidence and comfort level of the subject matter in a revolutionary new way!

We are going to utilize the micro:bit Python V2 web editor to design our project with detailed steps to help any educator regardless of their background or comfort level to implement this feature.
