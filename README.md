# MicroPython-micro-bit
# Study Buddy
The micro:bit Study Buddy is an educational engagement tool designed to help students learn a new classroom subject with the assistance of a micro:bit TED (Talking Educational Database) and a micro:bit TEQ (Talking Educational Quiz).

## Mission Statement
Over the next 10 years we are going to see a fundamental transformation of technology in a way never before seen in history.  

Future careers will look very different than they do today to which literally every opportunity will include the usage of a microcontroller in combination with an automation engine and the skills necessary to adapt to this new paradigm.
