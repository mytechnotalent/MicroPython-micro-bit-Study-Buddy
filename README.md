# Study Buddy
The micro:bit Study Buddy is an Electronic Educational Engagement Tool designed to help students learn a new classroom subject with the assistance of a micro:bit TED (Talking Educational Database) and a micro:bit TEQ (Talking Educational Quiz).

## Mission Statement
Over the next 10 years we are going to see a fundamental transformation of technology in a way never before seen in history.  

Future careers will look very different than they do today to which literally every opportunity will include the usage of a microcontroller in combination with an automation engine and the skills necessary to adapt to this new paradigm.

With this landscape directly over the horizon we need to empower our Educators, the single more important group of leaders in the twenty-first century, with the tools necessary to inspire and engage the next generation of makers in an exciting new way.

Today is born the concept of an Electronic Educational Engagement Tool to connect with students in a very emotional and inpiring way which will help solidify classroom subject curriculum in a significantly enhanced timeframe in addition to preparing these future leaders with the software engineering fundamanetls necessary to compete in tomorrow's economy.
